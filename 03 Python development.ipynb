There is no wrong choice here, it is simply a matter of what you think is more convenient, since every approach has its own benefits.\n",

    "Installing packages can be done with `conda` and with `pip`. The latter is the more common approach for installing new packages, also outside a Conda environment. Normally packages that are required for the scripts will be installed using `pip` by running `pip install mymodule`. Using `pip freeze` a dump will be made of the installed packages, including their version numbers. This information is usefull in case the script will be used on other machines. The output of the `pip freeze` is saved to `requirements.txt` and can be used again to install the packages by running `pip install -f requirements.txt`. It is common to save the requirement file also to version control such as Git.\n",
